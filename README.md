# bioactivity-prediction-app

A machine learning–powered web application for predicting the bioactivity (pIC50) of chemical compounds against acetylcholinesterase, a key drug target in Alzheimer’s disease research. Built with Python, RDKit, and Streamlit!

### Generating the PKL file

The machine learning model used in this web app will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter notebook [bioactivity_prediction_app.ipynb]. Upon successfully running all code cells, a pickled model called acetylcholinesterase_model.pkl will be generated.

###  Launch the app

```
streamlit run app.py
```
or explore the lovable version!
